# IS3107 Project: Spotified

# Background

Spotify is one of the top players in music streaming services. With over 500 million users on its platform listening to music, discovering new music, and curating playlists, it has become something of a necessity in the modern day (Spotify, n.d.). Spotify prides itself on its hyper-personalisation of services, which recommends users songs that align with their listening preferences. Another more recent campaign, Spotify Wrapped, summarises users’ listening data with fun and interactive visualisations.


## Problem Statement
Although Spotify has developed features aimed at providing a more personalised and engaging listening experience, users have expressed their dissatisfaction regarding its usefulness, which leaves much room for improvement. 

At present, there is no feature within Spotify that allows users to view their past listening statistics in real-time. Users are only able to view this data via the annually-recurring Spotify Wrapped. Additionally, the granularity of the data is low as it only covers basic statistics such as listening duration and the number of plays.

Another problem our project hopes to address is to provide more relevant and fresh music recommendations to users. Spotify’s recommendations come in many forms: Radio, Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes; but some common user complaints concerning them include (Reddit, ):
Repeatedly receiving song recommendations that a user has listened to before, making it difficult to discover new music.
Receiving irrelevant recommendations that do not reflect a user’s music preferences.
Receiving recommendations that were heavily skewed towards songs or artists that were already popular, making it difficult to discover underrated artists.

Overall, our project aims to address these issues and provide a user experience that is more personalised and engaging than what is currently available on Spotify.
